# WeatherWebsite
A weather website using weather API with JavaScript. 

As part of a mentorship for developers and future developers, I am being challenged to create a project from scratch using my previous knowledge in programming.
The challenge is to complete the project in 6 days by coding a little bit every single day, and I decided to to this weather website because I have done a similar project but with news, so I know I am able to complete within the given days.

My challenge will be remembering all the steps and working in the frontend part of the project because that is my main struggle. 

I have decided to use JavaScript for API consumption because that is a language I feel confortable with but am well aware that I still have a lot to learn about it. 

It will be a website where the users will type  the city they are at or the city they want to search and wether they want current information about the weather or the forecast for the next days.
